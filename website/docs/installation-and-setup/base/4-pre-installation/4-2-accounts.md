| Requirement | Mandatory? | Comment |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| [Nexus Account](https://users.nexusmods.com/register) | :white_check_mark: | Basic Nexus account is **mandatory**; it **must** be created before continuing. |
| [Nexus Premium](https://next.nexusmods.com/premium) | :x: | Nexus Premium is **strongly** recommended or the installation would take many more hours _(possibly days)_. |
