| **Clean** Skyrim in **ENGLISH** language installed in non-protected folder | :white_check_mark: | <ul><li>Before you do anything with _Wabbajack,_ ensure that _Skyrim_ is installed in a non-protected folder (for examle, the root of your drive is a good non-protected folder, like `D:\`). It **cannot** be located in `Program Files` _(that's a protected folder!)_ or the list would not function. Relocate the game if necessary. [Here's the Steam guide](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/4BD4-4528-6B2E-8327) on moving games to another folder/drive.</li> <li>[Here's a Bethesda's guide](https://help.bethesda.net/#en/answer/31431) on how to set the game to English.</li></ul> |
| [Skyrim AE paid `20$` upgrade](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1746860/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim_Anniversary_Upgrade/) | :white_check_mark: | This is required for the modlist to work, no exceptions. Regular `Special Edition` or free `CC` content won't do. |
