# ![System Requirements](./img/3-system-requirements.png)

---

The minimally recommended setup for an enjoyable experience **at 1080p** is at least:

- **CPU:** `Intel Core i7 8xxx` / `AMD Ryzen 5 5xxx` or newer _(basically any CPU with as high IPC as possible, core count doesn't matter much)_
- **GPU:** `NVIDIA RTX 2070 SUPER` / `AMD Radeon 5700 XT` at the minimum (8GB of VRAM). Newer models with **AT LEAST 12 GB OF DEDICATED VRAM** are much more preferable!
- any SSD _(you'd have a really bad time with HDD's)_
- **40 GB PAGEFILE, NO EXCEPTIONS** _(would be explained next in [pre-installation](pre-installation#general-pc-adjustments))_

:::caution
**IF YOU DO NOT MEET AT LEAST THESE TARGETS, THE MODLIST WILL PLAY LIKE A HARD FREEZING CRASH-PRONE PIECE OF CRAP!**

:::tip
Remember that higher resolutions require more powerful hardware!

:::note
For those who experience difficulties running *Licentia NEXT* (it's quite a demanding list after all), the previous curator of this modlist ‚Äî formerly known as *"Licentia"/"Licentia Classic"/"Licentia BLACK"* ‚Äî now curates a series of NSFW **"Nexus Vortex Collections"** with minimal design and modest system requirements.

You can check them out [here](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/vexation1977/collections)!
