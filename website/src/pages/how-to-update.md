:::tip
**TL;DR**

Download the modlist's `.wabbajack` file again and specify the same directories (basically the same as in the [installation step](#4-downloading-and-installing-the-list-from-wabbajack))
:::

## Detailed instructions

1. Go to Wabbajack UI, Browse Modlists, find _Licentia NEXT_ and click on it.

2. Click `Download & Install` button (it will download the updated `.wabbajack` file), and select the same directories as before if asked (usually *Wabbajack* correctly auto-detects your previous install).

3. Click `Install` and wait for the installation to finish.

4. Once you've opened the *Mod Organizer 2* (MO2) after the update, make sure your mods and plugins count matches the ones stated in the announcement.

:::note
_Wabbajack_ will only update what has changed, it will not repeat the entire installation &mdash; so this will be *much* faster than the initial installation.

It is rarely recommended to continue a save when you update a modlist (unless an update is labeled `Save Safe` in the changelog/announcement)!
:::

:::tip
If you want to keep your manually added mods, don't forget to prefix them with `[NoDelete]` in MO2, so _Wabbajack_ won't delete them during the update.
