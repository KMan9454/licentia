**How To Get The Skyrim Outfit System Mod To Work With Schlongs Of Skyrim Full (The New Easy Way)**

*A guide by Katiefraggle42*

**Problem:** Skyrim outfit system is an amazing mod that was originally made for Skyrim LE by DavidJCobb then ported to Skyrim SE by aers and then updated by thekineticeffect, who has done amazing work with it. The mod works flawlessly out of the box to bring transmog-like features to Skyrim, but only for female player characters and NPC’s, and male characters who use nevernude or SoS light. SoS Full gives a bunch of headaches when trying to get this mod to work on male toons who use SoS Full or SoS Full/Himbo. Until now! Recently thekineticeffect released the 0.7 beta which includes (IMO) a revolutionary workaround for this issue. And this guide is gonna help you set it up - because while is is fast to do - it is not intuitive, since it is in testing on their end.

![Meet Bob](/old_but_gold/sos_guide_images/image10.png)

Good day friends. Meet Bob Greymane. Bob has offered to help explain how this works. Bob just wants to adventure and meet his soulmate when he finally takes that arrow to the knee. Bob likes his hide armor - but he thinks a new look may help him feel better about himself, make his DPS better, and attract that soulmate he is looking for. As we all know - a well dressed toon performs much better than one that looks frumpy in their stock game armor.

Bob already installed all his Licentia Black Wabbajack list which includes Skyrim Outfit System 0.6. But Bob is still having issues with his nethers showing up when he’s being intimate with his chosen partner after a long day of adventuring. “How do we fix this?” He asked me one day a few months ago. I told him “I do not know Bob!” Today I found the way - and got on my horse and rode over to tell Bob how we were gonna fix his penis issue the easy way. Suffice to say he was excited to help.

*The following directions assume that you have the Licentia Black Wabbajack list installed already.  And that you are frustrated or are going to be frustrated by this mod and the things that SOS Full does to it. So let Bob and I save you some of that frustration and make this just work for all toons regardless of what is between their legs.*

1) Download the [Skyrim Outfit System v0.7.0 BETA1](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42162?tab=files) mod from the miscellaneous files section (I will update the link if a new version comes out). This is a manual download and will need to be installed with the new mod button that is located in the top left of the MO2 and looks like a folder icon.

2) Install the new version as “[NoDelete][Framework] Skyrim Outfit System v0.7.0 BETA1” without the “”. (Just copy and paste the name when you install). Then drag that new mod up to the Framework divider on the left side of MO2 and put it directly under the old one and activate it. Once you activate it - you need to deactivate the old one. The esp from the new one will stay where it is supposed to be in the list if you do it this way. Activate new one THEN deactivate the old one.

3) Hold the right CTRL key and double click the new outfit mod to open its folder in explorer. 

![explorer view of the mod](/old_but_gold/sos_guide_images/image3.png)

4) Double click the SKSE folder and then Double click the Plugins folder that is inside that. Your screen should show the contents of the plugin folder like this:

![inside the plugins folder](/old_but_gold/sos_guide_images/image8.png)

5) You are going to right click the “SkyrimOutfitSystemScript_CustomPolicy002.disabled.rhai”. This will be the 3rd file down. Choose to open the file with Notepad.

![code snippet](/old_but_gold/sos_guide_images/image7.png)

**DO NOT TOUCH THAT SNIPPET OF CODE. JUST DON’T DO IT. PLEASE! All we are doing here is resaving this file in the same folder but with a different name.** 

6) Rename the file to “SkyrimOutfitSystemScript_CustomPolicy001.rhai” (This is absolutely important. Please get the name correct without the quotes) and change the “save as type” drop down to ALL FILES. DO NOT SAVE IT AS A TXT FILE! PLEASE!

![where to put mod](/old_but_gold/sos_guide_images/image4.png)
  
We are now done with file things. Close the explorer window and Notepad. At this point we are ready to start the game and make Bob’s dreams and your toon’s dreams of being well dressed a reality.

Go ahead and fire it up. If you are starting a new game, please do your set up now as per the read me that was kindly provided to you by your friendly Wabbajack mod list creator, Cacophony. After your MCM is all set up and your game is loaded and you went through whatever start room you are in, you probably found some basic armor like Bob did to get you started. So go ahead and put that on and we will proceed.

Bob is wearing a full set of Hide armor (helm, armor, gauntlets, and boots) that he found in the wardrobe. But he’s missing the most important item to make this whole thing work. He doesn’t have a ring. He needs a ring to tie this whole outfit together. (No joke - you need a ring for real). So how does he get one? He could wait to set his outfit up to work with his penis - or he could console a ring - or he could use a mod like Skyrim Cheat Engine (My fav)  or AddItem Menu to get a ring (You would need to add one of these). Any ring will do - you can choose a nice ring - or a basic one. Up to you. It’s not a specific ring - your PC or Follower do need to wear a ring though.

So Bob used Skyrim Cheat Engine to get a really nice enchanted ring for 2 handed sword damage - this is because Bob is a big cheater. You can be like Bob if you want. Bob puts on his new ring along with all his new not so pretty hide armor.

7) Open your MCM menu - and scroll down to Skyrim Outfit System. If this is a new game we need to turn the mod on. So on the first screen - Enable the mod. 

![outfit mcm](/old_but_gold/sos_guide_images/image5.png)

You can enable other options here but for now just enable the mod and make sure your Toon’s name is in the dropdown.


8) On theOutfits screen - go ahead and select the create new empty outfit option. This will allow you to search for any armor from any mod you have installed. (It helps to know which outfit you are after first).

![outfit mcm 2](/old_but_gold/sos_guide_images/image2.png)

I already had an outfit for Bob from earlier - but a strapping guy like this can’t have just one. So a screen will pop up and give you the opportunity to name your outfit - Bob decided on “Bob’s cool new duds”.

The next screen is where the magic happens. Here you can search for your outfit. Bob liked the Evil Mastermind Armor - but prefers the stats of his Hide Armor for some reason - so we searched for Evil Master. Above that you can keep using that drop down to add all the pieces you want. In this case Bob didn’t want to hide his handsome face so we left the mask out. 

![where to put mod](/old_but_gold/sos_guide_images/image13.png)

*sidenote - Leaving the head slot empty is also how you can hide your helmet but still have one equipped. What? Yes.*

9) Notice I left the ring we equipped off the costume list. Bob likes gloves - so the rings will show up on the outside of the gloves if added to the list. Bob doesn’t like that look so I left it out. At this point Use the Base policy drop down to select Require equipped. So if an armor is equipped in one of the 3 slots that the costume uses it will transmog those pieces. If you were playing a female character you are done. But that’s not what this guide is about. And we are almost done. I promise.

Go ahead and tick the per-slot policy editor at this point. We need to tell the offending "Unofficial (Typically Pelvis Under)" body slot, that SoS adds to all body armor pieces, that it needs to not leave a big hole where the penis should be when Bob wants to get down with his partner. Remember that’s why we are here, dicks and rings.

![marking slot 52](/old_but_gold/sos_guide_images/image9.png)

So when you tick that per-slot editor option - the right screen changes to what you see above. Navigate to page 3 of 4 and change the Unofficial (Typically Pelvis Under) drop down to “Require Ring”. What? Ah - if you paid attention to the code snipped way back in the beginning it was named “Require Ring”. So go ahead and select “Go back to Outfit list” on the top left.

![activating outfit](/old_but_gold/sos_guide_images/image12.png)

Here now is the new outfit Bob wanted and we have to set it Active. So go ahead and do that and we are done. For real done. Any new outfits for males you would make the same way. You are all set up to make as many cool new duds for your Dude as you want.

Let’s back out and see the results.

![Bob's New Duds](/old_but_gold/sos_guide_images/image6.png)

So much better Bob.

In the interest of keeping this guide semi SFW I wont show the results when i take his armor and ring off. Trust me it works. Now as for this ring. You need to have a ring at all times. Whatever ring. Just any ring, equipped or this wont work and he will have a hole where his penis should be and he will be sad. To strip him nude - remove his armor AND the Ring. The Penis is tied to the ring. Call it a cock ring if you want. Ring on - SoS puts his penis away and he wears clothes Ring off - Sos reequips his penis so there is no hole. Try it out.

So that being said for Adult mod users - there is one more step. Both Ostim and SexLab frameworks strip toons when scenes are initiated. We need to tell these frameworks that the ring needs to be unequipped as well. For Ostim users (Licentia Black)  - go to Ostim’s mcm and choose the undressing tab - mark the 36 Ring option on the left side so that it is on. If it doesn’t auto strip the ring you will have an unwanted hole.

NOW YOU ARE DONE. GO FORTH AND FUCK AND CONQUER SKYRIM!
