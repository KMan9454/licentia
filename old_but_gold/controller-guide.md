**Step 1.  Enable all mods in the Controller section of MO2.**

Auto Input Switch allows you to freely move between keyboard and the controller.  Handy in many cases especially using OStim controls.

The Ultimate Control Scheme (TUCS) maps the controller to functions.  Look at the mod page for more info.

Essential Favorites prevents favorited items from being sold, crafted, disarmed, disenchanted, or dropped.  Not really a controller mod but handy.

Favorite Misc Items allows you to favorite books/soul gems/keys and other misc items.  Not really a controller mod but handy.

Serios Hotkeys Allows players to map hotkeys or use the vanilla hotkeys to equip weapons, shields, shouts, and spells in the right hand, left hand, and shout/power slots.  It enables 8 Hotkeys on the controller.  Explained in TUCS

**Step 2.  Enable Controller in Skyrim**

**Step 3. Change Verify the controls.**

Change Sneak to B.  This is necessary for The Ultimate Dodge Mod.  

**Step 4. Setup CGO**

Switch Grip DPad UP

Dual Wield Blocking DPAD Down

**Step 5. Setup The Ultimate Dodge Mod (TUDM)**

This is a little counter intuitive.  Set the Sneak Key to Left Arrow.  Your Dodge Key will now be "B" because that is what you set in Controls in Skyrim.  That's just the way things work.  Do Not set Gamepad/Controller Compatibility.  Makes it uncompatible.  Sprinting doesn't work as an example.  Why?  Ask Todd.

We use Left arrow for Sneak because we use QuickLoot.  Navigating that screen with the DPAD up and down causes sneaking hilarity.

**Step 6.  Setup Serios Hot Keys.**

The hotkey comes with the install as Home.  When you are in game and have weapons equipped, press Home amd its screens will come up. For that information, see the mod page.

You are done.

A note about Target Lock.  That is in True Directional Movement and already configured.

Your configuration now looks like:

Start: Journal

Back: Wait

LT: Left Attack

RT: Right attack

LB+Back: Quicksave

RB+Start: Tween menu (character menu)

LB+RB: Shout (in that order, you kinda haveta roll your fingers across them)

LB: Looking for something to do

RB: Sprint

LS: Favorites

RS: Switch POV

A: Activate

B: Roll

X: Ready weapon

Y: Jump

DPad Left: Sneak / Stop Sneaking

DPad Up: Switch grip between 1-handed and 2-handed (CGO)

DPad Down: Dual Wield Blocking

Go kill something.
