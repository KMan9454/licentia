# Licentia

## "All I want to be is a badass comic book hottie who fucks and cuts heads."

## Preamble

**This Modlist contains mods with sexual content, and you must be of legal age in your country (most Western countries: 18+, some Eastern ones: 21+)**.

_Licentia_ is one of _Wabbajack's_ oldest and most well-regarded adult modlists, featuring optional non-fetish content with the _OSuite_ series of _OStim_ mods and an emphasis on build variety, backed up by an accessible Power Fantasy design philosophy. 

**Prefer your sex loving and optional?** Play this modlist -- _Licentia._

**Prefer your sex abusive and intrusive?** Play its brother modlist -- _Servitium._

## Your Responsibilities as a Player, and Mine as a Modlist Author

### The Most Important Things To Know For Not Having A Really Bad Time With Wabbajack

Before you embark on your exciting _Wabbajack_ NSFW journey, let's get a few important points out of the way.

Please keep in mind that all of _Jolly Co-Operators_ modlists are constant works in progress, an absolute amateur effort to harmonize the work of dozens if not hundreds of amateur mod authors who have little interest in verifying that their creations work in every possible setup. You should **NEVER** expect a 100% polished, well-balanced and "perfect" experience. I am just one man who barely knows what he is doing (although a little more than the average potato), so cut me some slack.

As a Modlist User, I expect some small efforts into fixing your own issues, mostly by searching the documentation provided here and by the Discord channels. It's very likely any issue you encounter has already been solved - if this is the case and it's well known, don't be surprised if you get ignored. As a Modlist Author with little else to do with his free time, I expect to take my users seriously when they experience issues that are common enough to prompt more than one or two reports -- not blame them on the user or deny that they are issues -- and fix them when I can. **HOWEVER** if your issue is a rock slightly out of place, a particle of dust that looks weird or a patch of asscheek showing through some shorts, please go bother someone else. We're all modding a nearly 10 year old game here which already had a legendary reputation for bugginess, please temper your expectations.

Support shouldn't assumed to be instant, I am in full-time school and and actively seeking for better methods to supplement my income. I will get to you when I have time. Support should also not be expected or demanded -- sometimes you could figure it out yourself with just a little reading, others I just straight up don't have an answer for you. Please recall that much of your behavior demanding instant free helpful support would be laughed at if you tried it with a real corporation.

Finally, the **MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU CAN DO -- ABSOLUTELY** with **ANY** NSFW Wabbajack modlist is to **TAKE CARE OF YOUR SAVE.** Avoid saving frequently, during combat, or continuous reloads when you die -- you should approach the game as the ramshackle conglomeration of barely functioning hobby projects that it is. If you **DO NOT TAKE CARE OF YOUR SAVE** and try to force it, **EVERYTHING WILL BREAK** and you will experience all kinds of bugs that can't be solved. _It is generally recommended to save the game no more frequently than every five minutes, during periods of "low activity",_ -- no NSFW scenes, no combat, no huge events going on. If you can **FOLLOW THIS ONE PRIMARY DIRECTIVE** you will probably have a good experience. If you can't, you won't.

Now that I've described how to have a good time with my modlists, I sincerely hope you find one! Moving on.

### System Specifications

The recommended setup for an enjoyable experience **at 1080p** is at least

- intel i7 or AMD Ryzen 5 5000 or later
- NVIDIA RTX 2070 SUPER or AMD Radeon 5700 XT or later with **AT LEAST 12GB OF DEDICATED VRAM**
- **40GB PAGEFILE, NO EXCEPTIONS**

**IF YOU DO NOT AT LEAST MEET THESE TARGETS, THE MODLIST WILL PLAY LIKE A HARD FREEZING CRASH-PRONE PIECE OF CRAP.**

Remember that higher resolutions require more powerful Hardware.

### Requirements

- [Nexus Account](https://nexusmods.com/)

This account is mandatory; it must be created before continuing. Nexus Premium is strongly recommended or the installation will take many more hours (possibly days).

## Installation

Before you do anything with _Wabbajack,_ ensure that _Skyrim_ is installed in a non-protected folder (such as the root of your drive, like `C:\`). It **cannot** be located in _Program Files_ or the list will not function. Relocate the game as necessary.

For _Wabbajack_ to match its files, _Skyrim_ needs to be set to the English language. Other languages will not work.

_Licentia_ requires the additional _Creation Club Content_ from the _Skyrim Anniversary Edition Upgrade_ or the modlist will not install. The price is about $20. 

Create a directory on the root of one of your Solid State drives (such as `D:\Licentia`) where you wish the modlist to be installed. You need at least **600GB** free for this modlist and a few GBs in the _Wabbajack_ and _OS_ drives for caches. About half of these GBs are mod downloads; the downloads folder can be deleted or relocated after installation.

Ensure you have set antivirus exceptions for this folder, the _Skyrim_ vanilla game folder, and the _Wabbajack_ folder, or the installation will fail. Certain antivirus packages do not properly respect exceptions and cannot be fully disabled (_Webroot_ and _Bitdefender_ are examples of these). These tools must be uninstalled from your system.

Ensure that _OneDrive_ is **uninstalled** or **completely disabled.** This program locks some of _Skyrim_'s configuration files when in use and will cause the modlist to experience errors.

The _Microsoft Visual C++_ redistributable package is required for _Mod Organizer 2_ (as well as certain mods included with _Licentia_) and you can download it from _Microsoft._ Download the x64 version of "Visual Studio 2015, 2017, 2019 and 2022" [here](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe).

You must set your Advanced Memory Pagefile to at least 40GB or the modlist will constantly crash. On _Windows 11_ you can find this setting in the About page for your PC. [Here](https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/windows-11/how-to-manage-virtual-memory-on-windows-11) is a document to find the specific option; other versions of Windows are similar. Setting the minimum and maximum pagefile size to `40,960` on one Solid State Drive is recommended. 

##  Using Wabbajack

Login to _Nexus_ with the _Wabbajack_ app. This login can be found by clicking the **GEAR** icon in the top right. It will toggle over to "logged in" when successful.

Depending on your system specs, the download and installation process can take a long time. 

##  Problems with Wabbajack

There are many different scenarios where _Wabbajack_ will produce an error. Re-run _Wabbajack_ before seeking assistance. _Wabbajack_ will only download and reinstall the minimum necessary to get the modlist working. 

**Various files beginning with "cc" and ending with "esl" or "esm" failed to download.**

You did not purchase the $20 upgrade to Skyrim, and this is not negotiable. Purchase it, verify it, delete it and re-download it if necessary, and try again.

**Could not download x:**

Some Internet providers have difficulty accessing the servers hosting the list's files. Use a VPN (Virtual Private Network) with a terminus set to the United States. Free options include _ProtonVPN_ and _Cloudflare WARP._ If a download gets interrupted, delete all corrupt local copies before trying again.

**Wabbajack could not find my game folder:**

_Licentia Black_ will not work with a GOG or pirated game version. If you own the game on _Steam,_ return to the Installation step. If this still doesn't work, ensure you are not running Wabbajack as an Administrator. **Asking for help with pirated copies of the game will get you banned from Discord Support.**

**MEGA download cap exceeded.**

This shouldn't happen unless you download the list multiple times or download multiple _Wabbajack_ lists. Sign up for an account or wait for the timeout to expire.

## Post-Installation

### Verifying the Modlist

_Licentia_ is over **HALF A TERABYTE** in size with almost **HALF A MILLION** individual files. Given the likelihood of corrupted files during installation, it is strongly recommended that files be checked after installation.

**DO NOT OPEN MOD ORGANIZER 2 AFTER INSTALLATION.** This will cause the Verification to fail.

To verify the modlist, launch the _Wabbajack_ app again after installation.

Ensure that all the same settings are used as during the installation process. You need the **SAME** `.Wabbajack` file and the **SAME** Modlist and Downloads folders.

Click the **VERIFY** button in the Lower Right Corner of _Wabbajack._

Wait for the process to complete. It can take quite some time.

You **MUST** receive a popup webpage that is **BLANK** with **ZERO ERRORS** or you will have horribly weird bugs and crashes that are impossible to troubleshoot.

If you receive **ANY** errors you **MUST** reinstall the list with the "Overwrite" checkbox selected. Do not worry, it will not redo everything. _Wabbajack_ can scan itself to see what's wrong and repair only what needs to be repaired. 

**YOU MUST RECEIVE ZERO ERRORS. THIS IS NOT OPTIONAL.**

This may be much more difficult if your Internet connection is poor, or the _Wabbajack_ app is frequently interrupted.

### Tweaking the Modlist

If you wish to change your game's resolution, select the "INI Editor" from the _Tools_ menu along the icon bar of MO2 and change it via the `SkyrimPrefs.ini` file. Scroll down until you see the `[Display]` header and look for the `iSize` values. Note that the TYPICAL ORDER IS REVERSED, the HEIGHT is listed BEFORE the WIDTH.

If you are confident you meet the above target, but still experience severe performance drops, you may need to customize your `BIOS` settings to maximize your hardware. Refer to your motherboard's documentation. The most common failure point is too-low RAM speed, which can often be addressed by enabling the "XMP" or "DOCP" profiles.

### Launching the Modlist

Launch _ModOrganizer.exe_ from the directory in which you installed the list. Launch the game from the **SKSE** entry in the drop-down menu.

### Configuring MCMs for the Modlist

## WHEN YOU SPAWN IN HELGEN'S INN, DO NOT TOUCH ANYTHING!

Wait for all of the messages in the upper left corner of the screen to appear and disappear. A warning will be issued that this readme is mandatory for proper installation. Click through and continue to wait.

**NEW!!** The first handful of levels in this modlist can be rough. I have included a small note in your starting inventory that grants you a little boost at the start of your adventure. If you wish to boost yourself to level 5, read the note that says, "Read Me for 1,000 Starting XP!" Once you have received the "Level Up" notification, open the stats menu and choose your skills and perks. You must choose your skills for each level followed by a primary stat (such as Health, Magicka, or Stamina). CHOOSING THE PRIMARY STAT COMPLETES THE LEVEL UP. Pick the skills FIRST. Then close the level up menu, wait for all the skill notifications to complete, and open it again to choose your Perks. As a little bonus, you can sell the note to a general goods vendor (like Lucan or Belethor) to clean them out of gold and grant yourself a little nest egg for buying gear.

When all of the messages have disappeared, open the Main Menu with the `ESC` key and find the entry labeled "MCM Recorder." (They are in alphabetical order.) Here, you will find an MCM "Recording" labeled simply "MCM Recording." Click on it, answer "Yes," and use `ESC` to back out of all menus. You will receive a popup asking if you wish to play the recording; please do so.

Once again, please wait for all of the messages in the upper left corner of the screen to appear and disappear. 

That's it! Your modlist is configured.

## FINAL NOTES

When you reach your first exterior world location, you will be prompted to enable Survival Mode. This mod disables fast travel and requires eating, sleeping, and staying warm to survive. The option can be changed later in the default "Gameplay" settings of Skyrim.

You will also receive a prompt about which Divine and/or Daedra you wish to worship, depending on your race. Choose according to your preference.

## TROUBLESHOOTING

Refer to [Troubleshooting](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for answers to common problems with the modlist.

## Updating the Modlist

Download the modlist's `.wabbajack` file again and specify the same directories. _Wabbajack_ will only update what has changed, it will not repeat the entire installation. It is rarely recommended to continue a save when you update a modlist.

## Removing the Modlist

You can just remove the _Licentia_ folder.
