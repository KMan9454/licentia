## LICENTIA 12.18

**A Bit of a Note About This Update**

I am sick of users dealing with animation bugs I can't replicate -- specifically, when the player gets "stuck" in crafting, sleeping, or _Animated Traversal_ animations. They can be resolved with the `player.moveto player` console command but for some they are so frequent as to make the list almost unplayable. My staff confirms that they do not manifest without _Improved Camera_, so that mod has been removed. You are just going to have to deal with the lack of a first person body and POV sex, not even returning _Improved Camera_ to its default configuration solved it.

There is also another change many of you will probably not enjoy. I am convinced that _SMP_ contributes a lot to other crashes some users experience. It's almost always somewhere in the log whenever a crash occurs. I find little value in _SMP,_ I don't turn it on for sex scenes and most of the physics are a joke. I don't know how many times I've seen a dead guy's cape flying up like a banner or my own hair twisting off into infinity when I change camera modes. The only time I do bother with it is if I want to strip down and walk slowly toward the camera for a few seconds to admire the jiggle. So, I'm going to try without it for awhile. I believe the list will be more playable but you be the judge.

I should probably remove _DynDOLOD NG_ as well, since the crash on multiple load bug doesn't appear to be resolved, but that requires hours of regenerating LODs, so I settled for Updating the DLL instead. Maybe it'll make a difference, maybe it won't. I rarely if ever had any of the problems mentioned.

Lastly I finally corrected the darkface on Vilja and a couple of Bruma border guards properly.

The main Male and Female folders are from official preset "mods" on Nexus. The User Submissions folder has presets from my user presets channel. (They are still very messy.) All sculpts can be found a couple directories above, in the Sculpts folder.
